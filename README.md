# tth-techdegree-project2
Second project for the teamtreehouse.com techdegree.

A description of the project
- We have a list of students which are displayed in <li> elements in zje index.html
- We should add pagination to the index page so only a limit of students are shown
- be clicking on the pagination links, which we should implement, the user can click through the studens

The skills, techniques and process used to complete the project:
- Event-Listeners
- Manipulating the DOM
- Training Loops

Problems I had:
- I was mostly reading the Study Guide for this project 
- therefore I did not look again to the project description on the treehouse website
- this could have saved me an amount of time

“Extra Credit” features:
